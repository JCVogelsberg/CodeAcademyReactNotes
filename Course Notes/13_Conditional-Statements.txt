Day 13 - Conditional Statements
-------------------------

- A conditional statement checks specific condition(s) and performs a task
based on the condition(s).
- Also known as 'flow control'
- Control flow enables developers to write programs that make decisions
- Examples: if, else if, else, switch



---------------- IF/ELSE ----------------
- The usual
- How non-boolean data types (strings or numbers) are evaluated:

  let myVariable = 'I Exist!';
  if (myVariable) {}
  // myVariable will evaluate to true. Because it has a value, it is 'truthy'

- 'Truthy' values: non-'falsy' values

- 'Falsy' values:
  * 0
  * Empty strings: "" or ''
  * Null which represent when there is no value at all
  * Undefined which represent when a declared variable lacks a value
  * NaN (Not a Number)

- Works the same as an if/else statement checking for username, and assigning
'Stranger' if they don't have one:

  let defaultName = username || 'Stranger';

...because the left condition is evaluated first.


---------------- Ternary Operator ----------------
- Can be used to shorten if/else Statements
- Ternary operators can be used for conditions which evaluate to true or false.

  let isNightTime = true;
  if (isNightTime) {
    console.log('Turn on the lights!');
  } else {
    console.log('Turn off the lights!');
  }

... can be shortened to:

  isNightTime ? console.log('Turn on the lights!') :
  console.log('Turn off the lights!');


- To us comparison operators with ternary operators, put them in parentheses:

  let isGood = 'It's Good!';
  (isGood === 'It's Good!') ? console.log('GOOD') :
  console.log('NOT GOOD')
