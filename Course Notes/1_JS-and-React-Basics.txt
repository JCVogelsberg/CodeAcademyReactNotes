Build Front-End Web Applications from Scratch
Day 1 "Overview of JavaScript and React"
================================================

- Web Apps:
	* Interactive user interfaces
	* Ability to persist data from one visit to the next
	* Front-end interfaces that can update without needing to make a request to the server on every click

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

- React solves the problem of messy spaghetti code by breaking the code into components. 

- There is typically one component for each discrete feature of the site, and each of the components follows the same general structure. 

- This means that the same code patterns will be enforced throughout the application, which will make the site more maintainable and readable as it is updated.

- Does a lot of clever calculations to make sure updates are calculated efficiently, improving performance.

SEVEN FUNDAMENTAL DATA TYPES:
1) Number
2) String
3) Boolean
4) Null (the intentional absence of a value)
5) Undefined (the absence of a value, but different use than null)
6) Symbol (a newer feature, unique identifier, useful in complex coding)
7) Object (Collections of related data)
