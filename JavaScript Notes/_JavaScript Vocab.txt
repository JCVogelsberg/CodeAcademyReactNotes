JavaScript Vocab
-------------------------

- Objects: variables that contain data, such as numbers, strings, whatever

- Methods:
  * variables defined in objects which are functions 
  * when called, can access and manipulate the data within the object


- Callback Functions:
  * Functions that get passed in as parameters and invoked
  * Callback functions do NOT have parentheses (parentheses = invoking)
  * .map() always

- constructor: 
  * Constructor functions are functions that when called, create a new object and assign it to the 'this' in the constructor function call
  
- super:
  * a function used to call the constructor of the parent class & access functions on an object's parent class
