Day 13 - Stateless Components From Stateful Components
-------------------------
"In this lesson, you will learn how to pass props from a stateful parent component to a stateless child component. This programming pattern will provide context on when to use props versus state."

- Our first programming pattern!

Two React components: 
- A stateful component & a stateless component
  * 'Stateful': Any component that has a state property
  * 'Stateless': Any component that does not have a state property

- Rendering is the only way for a component to pass props to another component.

- Any component rendered by a different component must be included in an export statement.




Example:

  // In Parent.js
  render() {
    return <Child name={this.state.name} />
  }

- Rendering <Parent /> will render both components, because Parent's render function returns a <Child />
