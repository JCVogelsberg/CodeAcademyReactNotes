Day 17 - HTTP Requests
-------------------------
- HTTP:
  * 'Hypertext Transfer Protocol'
  * Used to structure requests & responses over the internet
  * HTTP requires data to be transferred from one point to another over the network

- The transfer of resources happens using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Once the TCP connection is established:
  * the client sends a HTTP GET request to the server to retrieve the webpage
  * After the server has sent the response, it closes the TCP connection
  * If you open the website again, or browser requests something from, a new connection is opened which follows the same process described above.
