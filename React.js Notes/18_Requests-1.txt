Day 18 - Requests I
-------------------------

- AJAX: a set of techniques for creating asynchronous requests using JS 
- How to make these requests using two techniques: 
  * XMLHttpRequests
  * jQuery

- GET request: retrieves a resource, 'gets' it
- POST request: creates a resource, 'posts' it to the server

- Things used in this lesson:
  * JS's XHR object: used to make GET & POST requests
  * Query strings
  * Datamuse API: for GET requests 
  * Rebrandly URL Shortener API: for POST requests
  * JSON: JavaScript Object Notation, the format in which our data is sent to us.

---------------- JS Event Loop ----------------  
- JS uses an event loop to handle asynchronous function calls. 

- When a program is run:
  * function calls are made & added to a stack
  * functions that make requests that wait for servers to respondare sent to a separate queue. 
  * Once the stack has cleared, then the functions in the queue are executed.

- Web devs use the event loop to create a smoother browsing experience by deciding:
  * when to call functions 
  * how to handle asynchronous events.
