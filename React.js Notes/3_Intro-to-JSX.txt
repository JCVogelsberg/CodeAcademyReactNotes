Day 3 - Intro to JSX
-------------------------
- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, designed to be used with React.
- Syntax extension: compiled by a JSX compiler into regular JavaScript

Example:

  const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;

- The H1 above is a JSX element
- JSX elements look a lot like HTML
- The only noticeable difference is that you find them in JS files instead of HTML files
- JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions:
  * can be saved in a variable
  * passed to a function
  * stored in an object or array

Example:
  // JSX element saved in a variable
  const navBar = <nav>I am a nav bar</nav>;

  // Several JSX elements being stored in an object:
  const myTruck = {
    engine: <li>2UZ-FE</li>,
    transmission: <li>A340</li>,
    rearDiff: <li>8-inch LSD</li>
  };

- JSX elements can have attributes, just like HTML elements can.
