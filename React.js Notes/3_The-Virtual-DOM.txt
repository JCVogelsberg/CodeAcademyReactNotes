Day 3 - "The Virtual DOM"
-------------------------
- DOM manipulation is the heart of the modern, interactive web. 
- Unfortunately, it is also a lot slower than most JS operations.
- Also, most JS frameworks update the DOM much more than they have to

Example:
  + You have a list w/ 10 items
  + Check off 1 item
  + Most JS frameworks would rebuild the entire list
  + That's 10x more work than necessary

- To address this unnecessary work, React uses the Virtual DOM 


---------------- The Virtual DOM ----------------
- In React, for every DOM object, there is a 'virtual DOM object'
- A virtual DOM object is a lightweight copy
- Think of manipulating the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint, as opposed to moving rooms in an actual house.
- When you render a JSX element, every single virtual DOM object gets updated, then React compares the virtual DOM with a virtual DOM snapshot taken before.
- React figures out exactly which virtual DOM objects have changed. This process is called 'diffing'

(Diffing sounds like video compression, where only what's different in a scene gets changed)

- Once React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, then React updates ONLY those objects on the real DOM. 


---------------- Basic Summary ----------------
1)   The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
2)   The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. React figures out which objects have changed.
3)   The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.
4)   Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.
