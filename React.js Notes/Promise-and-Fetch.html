- Promise: An object that handles asynchronous data. 

- A promise has three states:
  * Pending: when a promise is created or waiting for data.
  * Fulfilled: the asynchronous operation was handled successfully.
  * Rejected: the asynchronous operation was unsuccessful.

- Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, you can chain an additional 
method to the original promise.  <--- 'then' METHOD???

----------------------------------------------  

- The fetch() function:
  * Creates a request object that contains relevant information that an API needs.
  * Sends that request object to the API endpoint provided.
  * Returns a promise that ultimately resolves to a response object, which contains the status of the promise with information the API sent back.

- renderJsonResponse() is a helper function found in public/helperFunctions.js.

<script>
// Boilerplate code for a GET request using fetch() and .then()

  // AJAX function
  const getSuggestions = () => {
    const wordQuery = inputField.value;
    const endpoint = `${url}${queryParams}${wordQuery}`;
    
    fetch(endpoint).then(response => {
      if (response.ok) {
        return response.json();
      }
      throw new Error('Request failed!');
    }, networkError => {
      console.log(networkError.message)
    }).then(jsonResponse => {
      renderResponse(jsonResponse);
    })
  }
