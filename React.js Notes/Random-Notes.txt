Random Notes:
- The constructor argument 'props' pulls its value from the from the React.Component class

- The stuff on the right-hand side of an assignment (everything after the =) is called an expression.

- Flow:
You pass the state of a user's [whatevers] from the App component down to components that render them.

- Include 'this.props.name-of-information' in return statement: 
  
  component class
    render method 
      return statement <----



- When a child component updates their parents' state, will the Parent Method always be an event handler?

  My understanding is this ... the child component would have the event listener, and likely the event handler that then passes the new value to the parent component, which then contains a method to update the state in the parent component. I could be wrong, but thats how I visualize it. For expample, the child component could have an input field with an onChange event listener, there would be a handleChange event handler in the child class that extracts the value from the event object, and passes it to the parent. The parent would then have a method for .setState to update state with the value being passed back.
